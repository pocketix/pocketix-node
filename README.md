# **IoTiX Node**
A backend module for interpreting and executing IoTiX V1 automation scripts — designed for smart devices and IoT integrations.

## **Overview**
**IoTiX Node** is an interpret for the IoTiX v1 ecosystem. It allows programs written in the IoTiX V1 visual programming language to be evaluated, interpreted, and transformed into actionable commands for downstream smart devices.

The module provides interfaces and abstract classes to connect automation logic with real-world device layers, without directly triggering hardware actions — making it ideal for simulation, testing, and safe validation.

## **Features**
✅ Evaluates IoTiX V1 programs into commands and device state updates  
✅ Does not directly interact with hardware — supports dry-run simulations  
✅ Plug-in architecture via interfaces: define your own commander and reference system  
✅ Easily extendable for custom gateways, validation logic, or IoT orchestration

## **Usage**

To get started, implement your own classes for the following:
- `ICommander`: Handles dispatching commands to smart devices
- `IReferenceManager`: Manages reference resolution and state tracking
- `ReferencedValue`: Extend this abstract class to define reference behavior

Then run the program using:
```ts
const runner = new ProgramRunner()  
.setCommander(commander)  
.setReferenceManager(referenceManager)  
.parseProgram(program);

const {commands, toUpdate} = await runner.run();
```
- `commands` contains the actions to be sent to the devices
- `toUpdate` contains the device states or parameters that changed as a result of the evaluation

The runner **does not** send commands or apply changes itself — this is left to your implementation. This allows for full control over validation, batching, and decision logic before executing device actions.

✅ Use it for:
- Safe program simulations (dry-runs)
- Validation of automations
- Command previewing or auditing

## **Tests**
Unit tests are located in the `/tests` directory.

To run the test suite:
```bash
npm run test
```
